# project
I wasnt aware that i was supposed to have a repo on github but thats my fault, i take full accountability. I apologize. I was struggling at first but i managed to find a video and have a friend help me with the code. I worked on it in repl.it the whole time. I'll send the replit and the replit will show my progress to confirm my work.
